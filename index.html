                Water makes up about 80% of our body at birth and an average
                of 60% in adulthood. The total amount of water varies
                depending on body weight, age, sex, and the presence of
                adipose tissue. Water has numerous roles in our body: it is
                the primary solvent and carrier of nutrients, plays a vital
                role in circulation, participates in all metabolic processes,
                and removes harmful substances from the body.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Most people think that drinking tap water cannot harm them in
                any way. But not all cities have water of the same quality,
                and pipes are not well preserved everywhere either. Tap water
                is usually chlorinated, full of hard minerals, and contains
                <span>chemical contaminants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                So, if you’re worried about the quality of the tap water in
                your home, but you do not know whether you need a water
                filter, you might consider trying a TDS tester, also known as
                a TDS meter. A TDS tester is pretty affordable and easy to
                use.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Before you buy it, keep in mind that the TDS meter cannot
                measure the contaminants in the water. Today we’re going to
                explain everything you need to know about TDS meters and help
                you decide whether you need to buy one.

              <p class="mb-3">
                Before we start with explaining what a TDS meter is, you should
                know that TDS means Totally Dissolved Solids. TDS refers to the
                total amount of dissolved solids in the water that runs through
                pipes.

            <p class="mb-3">
              When it rains, the water drops dissolve the soil and the
              minerals on the ground. When these minerals dissolve, a part of
              them gets absorbed by water. That’s how the water gets its
              “natural” taste. This process raises water pH levels by adding
              sodium, magnesium, and calcium minerals.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              The water that contains high levels of minerals is called
              “hard.” Whether the water will be hard or soft depends on where
              you live. Water hardness is determined by the
              <span>Water Quality Association.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              According to them, water is considered hard when it has more
              than 120ppm or 3.5 grains per gallon. When the TDS levels drop
              to 17mg/L, the water is soft with good acidity and lower pH
              levels.

            <p>
              A TDS meter or tester looks like a small device that indicated the
              Total Dissolved Solids in liquids, but it usually helps to
              determine TDS in water. Salts and minerals increase
              <span>the conductivity of water</span>, and the TDS meter
              estimates and measures the total amount of dissolved solids.

              You can also hear that experts call them PPM or TDS testers, but they all serve the same purpose. Advanced TDS tester models with more features are expensive, but you can purchase the basic model for about $10.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              The main difference is that a basic TDS tester only measures the amount of total dissolved solids in the water, while more advanced models can check the temperature and salinity.

              <p class="mb-3">
                When your water has high levels, that usually means your water is full of dissolved solids. Those solids are usually minerals. If the water that runs through your pipes has a high mineral concentration, these minerals can cause severe problems after a while.

          <div class="container">
            <p class="mb-3">
              For example, the constant presence of hard minerals can build up scale in your pipes and home appliances that use water. After a while, you might have <span>problems with water pressure</span> and eventually end up with damaged home appliances such as your coffee machine.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              So, if you want to avoid this, you should consider measuring TDS in your water. Only if you are aware of TDS levels in the water you drink, you can determine whether you need to do something about it. You may need to install a salt-free water conditioner or a water softener solution.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Salt-free water conditioners serve to dissolve hard minerals into soft and tiny particles that cannot accumulate in your pipes over time. Water conditioners can protect your clothes, skin, hair and save you from cleaning white stains off the shower door. More importantly, they can protect your faucets, plumbing, and pipes from scale buildup.

            <h3 class="h3">What can a TDS meter actually measure?</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
              As we already mentioned, a TDS meter cannot measure harmful particles and contaminants in your water. Namely, the TDS tester does not tell you whether your water is healthy or not. This analog device can only measure the amount of total dissolved solids in the water, and it cannot determine the name of these solids nor the harmful effects that those solids have on your overall health.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              For example, your TDS tester can have a high reading, but that does not mean your water contains harmful contaminants. <span>Healthy minerals</span> like magnesium, calcium, and potassium can confuse your TDS meter with a high reading. If you have a water filter that remineralizes the water, the TDS meter will also have high readings, besides the fact that such water filters add healthy minerals to your water.

            <p>
              On the other hand, the TDS meter can also have low readings even though your water contains contaminants like pharmaceuticals, metals, chromium, or pesticides. So, if you want to determine the water quality in your home, and find out if the present solids in your water are harmful to your health, do not rely on TDS testers.

            <h2 class="h2">Is a high reading on the TDS meter an indicator that you need to install a water filter?</h2>
            <p>
              Let us quickly summarize the things we explained above. The TDS meter simply reads the amount of fully dissolved solids in your water supply system. It can read the quantity, but it is not a qualitative measure indicator. That means that readings on the TDS meter cannot determine the substances in your water and whether they are harmful to your health.

          <div class="container">
            <p class="mb-3">
              In other words, you cannot wholly rely on TDS meter readings and decide to install a water filter. A <span>central water filter system is an excellent solution</span> for significant water problems, but the TDS levels cannot tell you if you need one.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              If you want to know whether you need a water filter, you should consider calling experts to <span>take a water sample</span> and examine water quality in your home. When you decide to buy the water filter, you need to choose the one that will not remove every trace of TDS and good minerals because you do not want to drink low-quality water.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              It would be best to go for water filters that will preserve the good minerals and remove only harmful contaminants that can risk your health. There is also a countertop or under sink water filter solution that addresses only contaminants present in your water supply system.

            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              These solutions are great if you want to filter water in a specific area, but if you’re going to have filtered water in your whole house, you should install the central water filtration system.

              <p class="mb-3">
                While TDS levels cannot tell you anything about the quality of your drinking water, measuring it can still help you determine whether or not your pipes and home appliances may be at risk. High concentrations of hard minerals in your water can take a toll on your pipes and damage them in the long run. However, minerals in water can be beneficial to your health and that of your plants and pets. After all, who wants to drink water void of any minerals at all?
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                TDS meters are highly affordable. Hence measuring the TDS levels of your tap water is very inexpensive. However, if you want to know more about the actual quality of your home's drinking water, you should go for more elaborate testing methods. Then go ahead and install a proper filtering system to ensure you and your family are drinking the best water available.
